## Description

This is an intuitive web3 application created using React, Solidity, and the Ethers.js library. It leverages the power of Ethereum networks to provide a decentralized experience for managing ships docking and undocking at a port. The application is built using Solidity smart contracts, the powerful Ethers.js library, and uses the user-friendly MetaMask wallet extension.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Solidity**: Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. It is used to write the Seaport smart contract in this project. [Learn more about Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/).

- **Ethers.js**: Ethers.js is a JavaScript library that provides a concise and consistent API for interacting with Ethereum and Ethereum-like networks. It is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and execute transactions in this project. [Explore Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/).

- **MetaMask**: MetaMask is a popular browser extension wallet that allows users to manage Ethereum accounts and interact with decentralized applications. It is used to connect to the Ethereum network and perform transactions in this project. [Get MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

- **Hardhat**: Hardhat is a development environment and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts. It provides tools for compiling, deploying, and testing contracts. Hardhat is used to compile and deploy the Seaport smart contract in this project. [Discover Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

## Installation ⬇️

### Follow these steps to get the project up and running 🏗️

1. Download or clone the project.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the local blockchain using Hardhat by running `npx hardhat node`.
4. Open a new terminal and deploy the Seaport contract using `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js`.
5. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.

### Configure MetaMask to use the Hardhat node 🦊

1. Open the MetaMask extension in your browser.
2. Click on the account icon in the top right corner and select "Settings".
3. In the "Networks" tab, click on "Add Network".
4. Fill in the following details:
   - Network Name: hardhat-test-network
   - RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545/
   - Chain ID: 31337
   - Currency Symbol: ETH
5. Click on "Save" to add the Hardhat network to MetaMask.

### Add accounts using private keys from Hardhat for testing 🔑

1. In the MetaMask extension, click on the account icon in the top right corner.
2. Select "Import Account" or "Import Account using Private Key" (depending on your version of MetaMask).
3. In the "Private Key" field, enter one of the private keys provided by Hardhat.
   - To access the list of private keys, open the terminal where you started the Hardhat local network.
   - The private keys are displayed as part of the accounts generated by Hardhat.
4. Click on "Import" to import the account into MetaMask.
5. Repeat the above steps to add more accounts for testing purposes.

> If you need detailed instructions or visual guidance, you can refer to this step-by-step guide on [how to use MetaMask with a Hardhat node](https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408642503449-Using-MetaMask-with-a-Hardhat-node).

## Usage 🪜

**To use the application, follow these instructions:**

1. After connecting MetaMask to the Hardhat local network, connect your wallet with the application.
2. You can dock or undock ships using the provided input fields and buttons.
3. Enter the ship address in the input field and click the "Dock Ship" button to dock a ship.
4. Click the "Undock Ship" button to undock a ship.
5. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
6. The ship details will be updated, showing the port number and the ship address.

## Contract Details 🔗

The smart contract used in this project is named `seaport` and is located inside the `contracts/seaport.sol` file. It allows users to dock and undock ships at the port. The contract emits events for successful docking and undocking operations.
```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract seaport{
    address public owner;
    uint public totalports=3;
    uint public totalShips=0;

    constructor(){
        owner=msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner(){
        require(msg.sender==owner,"Only Owner Can Access");
        _;
    }

    mapping(uint=>bool) public portavailability;
    mapping(uint=>address) public shipatport;

    function dockShip(address _shipaddress) public onlyOwner{
        require(totalShips<3,"no port available");
        for(uint i=1;i<=3;i++){
            if(portavailability[i]==false){
                portavailability[i]=true;
                shipatport[i]=_shipaddress;
                totalShips++;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    function undockShip(address _shipaddress)public onlyOwner{
        require(totalShips>0,"no ship to remove");
        uint portofship=1;
        bool shipfound=false;

        for(uint i=1;i<=3;i++){
            if(shipatport[i]==_shipaddress){
                portofship=i;
                shipfound=true;
            }
        }

        shipatport[portofship]=address(0);
        portavailability[portofship]=false;
        totalShips--;

        if(!shipfound){
            revert("Ship Not Found!");
        }

    }

    function assertAvailabilty() public view{
        assert(totalShips>=0 && totalShips<=3);
    }
}

```

## Configuration ⚙️

The `hardhat.config.js` file is used for configuring the Hardhat development environment. It specifies the Solidity version and required libraries to deploy contracts on the Hardhat node.

## Scripts 📜

The `deploy.js` script, located in the `scripts` folder, is used to deploy the Seaport contract. It uses Hardhat's `ethers` library to interact with the blockchain. This script is executed with the `npx hardhat run` command.
